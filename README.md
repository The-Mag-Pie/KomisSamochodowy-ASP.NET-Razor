# Komis samochodowy .NET Razor Pages (.NET 7)
Simple web application created in Razor Pages for used car dealer to present available cars for sale.

Implemented functionalities:
1. Entity Framework with SQLite database
2. API Controllers
3. ASP Routes
4. Dependency injection (DbContext)
5. AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)

The UI of the app may be a little bit poor because I mainly focused on backend.

<b>Important:</b> Default username and password: admin/admin
